# Improving E-Mitra Kiosks

Under Emitra, Common Service Center (CSC) counters or kiosks are set up in urban and rural areas to provide services related to different government departments without the need for people to visit government offices.


## Why improve E-mitra?

It is not only easing out the process of delivering services but also promoting female entrepreneurship and generating employment.

## Map based Interface for Kiosk Status

● We use state of the art Natural Language Processing to analyse customer reviews and modify kiosk ratings.

● Ratings can be used to decide on incentives.

● There would a voice recognition based complaint/review system which modifies ratings in real time.
